GUI
*  multi language, files in services, swap in GUI server ... (keep lang of users)
  restirict session id to a connection
  limit commands that can be used before login
  start websocket on enable

_core
   a call without id means, it dosnt need its callback
*   user access
    add title to services
    make _core a service! ( need um,db to activate...)
  manage different states in db vs from service (onConnect)
  exes, node generator

    how can DB service register its permisssions when UM is not loaded yet?!
    in comm, make string compare case insensitive(commands & events)

    error codes

    auto-create local db
    filtered events (on data fields)
    Use 'service' onlu, instead of 'extension' or 'plugin'
    move codes to ExtensionProfile or Extension Manager from Router

    check requirements by servicetype

    stop communication if UM is not running
    callback for enable,disable,install,uninstall,
    make Service.state pruvate, provide setter,getter. fire events on change!

    stop service if required is stopped
    registerCommand=>get info from serviceInfo, if exist register with that data
    check command's required permission(mentioned in installinfo) beside default one (2check in one go?)
    extmanager.save, update only if its changed. use getter setters
    update reSat. when other services got Enabled!
UM
    break on invalid id, in check permission
    set permission commands
    session timeout
    logout when gui disconnects
    multi check permission command?

    dont use *
    try removing macros?
    make inheritance mor simple? ( only implmnt a constructor?

all:
    multiLang
    cache man util( core service )
    Auto-gen [service]utility, install infos, nodes, ... ,... ,!!!
    rename all .lenght()s to .size()
    add a [success] field to "callback" packets? ( use this instead of error packet!)
    inline commands.(script, store in core, fast run)

NET:
    multi-thread receive pool handler
